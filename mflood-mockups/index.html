<!-- home page that shows a list of journal entries with just the title and date created.

- Each entry in the list on the home page should have a link that leads to the detail page.

- The home page should also have a UI element that allows you to start to create a new entry.
It should link to the page with the create form.

- You should make an effort to make the pages in your mockup look as unified as possible.
Ensure that there is a common header, footer and navigation system shared among all the pages.
